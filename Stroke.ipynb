Since then, some other definitions for the ischemic penumbra have been proposed based on energy metabolism, CBF thresholds and protein synthesis.Because the target of thrombolytic therapy in acute stroke is the brain tissue at risk of infarction, the most clinically relevant definition of the penumbra indicates the ischemic tissue but still viable and salvageable if local perfusion is efficiently restored.It is widely acknowledged that the mismatch of abnormality volume between perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has previously and frequently been applied as an imaging equivalent of the ischemic penumbra. The concept of perfusion-diffusion mismatch (PDM) provides a practical and approximate measure of the tissue at risk and has been increasingly applied for the evaluation of acute stroke in animals and patients"

Stroke caused by cerebral infarction should be distinguished from two other kinds of stroke: cerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. A cerebral infarction occurs when a blood vessel that supplies a part of the brain becomes blocked or leakage occurs outside the vessel walls. This loss of blood supply results in the death of tissue in that area. Cerebral infarctions vary in their severity with one third of the cases resulting in death.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hemorrhagic infarcts are infarcts commonly caused by occlusion of veins, with red blood cells entering the area of the infarct, or an artery occlusion of an organ with collaterals or dual circulation. This is commonly seen in brain , lungs, liver and the GI tract, areas referred to as having \"loose tissue,\" or dual circulation. Loose-textured tissue allows red blood cells released from damaged vessles to diffuse through the necrotic tissue. White infarcts can become hemorrhagic with reperfusion. Compare to Anemic infarct. Hemorrhagic infarction is also associated with testicular torsion\n",
    "\n",
    "> Anemic infarcts (also called white infarcts or pale infarcts) are white or pale infarcts caused by arterial occlusions, and are usually seen in the heart, kidney and spleen. These are referred to as \"white\" because of the lack of hemorrhaging and limited red blood cells accumulation, (compare to Hemorrhagic infarct). "

    "## Flow is usually prolonged, but not always.  Pressure and resistance adaptations may be so effective as to keep flow at or near baseline (the slope of the curve stays about the same) — which is why Time to Peak is more sensitive than flow.  On the other hand, if flow is normalized, the area might do well even without pharmacologic or mechanical reperfusion.\n",

    "## Volume is variable, and not as intuitive.  The volume that’s measured is NOT volume of blood in voxel per se, but rather volume of contrast bolus over some defined measurement time.  Volume of blood in dead brain is actually high, but as the area has no inflow, no contrast gets in, and so measured volume is low.  The adaptive response to occlusion is decreasing resistance, which means means increasing vascular bed capacitance (i.e. vasodilatation), which means increase in total volume.  Effective collateral adaptation can result in increase in total volume (CBV) measurement within the affected territory (see example below).  Alternatively, poor collateral responce means less effective inflow, and overall decrease in volume. Whatever the case, low CBV is always bad news.

    "This patient underwent perfusion imaging within 30 minutes of symptom onset.  CBF is low, yet CBV is very high.  Its is unusual to see such a big discrepancy — essentially implying that despite severely reduced inflow (CBF), the tissue is still able to not only normalize but increase its total measured volume (CBV).  It would seem that the situation is favorable. The artery was mecanically opened (Solitaire) within the next hour, less than 2 hours from symptom onset, yet final infarct was completely matched to the area of occlusion (CT scan below).  It may be that the scan was obtained early enough, when the brain was still alive, or perhaps not, but its vascular bed continued to allow for slow inflow.  Either way, some suggest that perfusion might not be as reliable when obtained very early in the ictus, as this case illustrates."

Immediately after an acute ischemic insult, there is progressive loss of high-energy intracellular ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr), with resultant decreases in the phosphocreatine/inorganic phosphate (PCr/Pi) ratio. 31P MRS can detect these alterations within minutes after the onset of ischemia, whereas the signal alteration on T2-weighted images is not observed until 11/2 to 3 hours after arterial occlusion.10,92\n",

N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) is thought to be located solely in neuronal bodies and has been shown to be either depleted or completely absent from infarcted tissue on MRS.11,83 Thus it is speculated that areas of the brain that have elevated lactate concentrations but also exhibit normal levels of NAA may represent ischemic tissue that is potentially salvageable. However, aside from the experimental context, current MRS methodology holds little role in the clinical management of stroke given the associated medical and logistical problems in the patient with acute ischemia."

    "The risk of embolic stroke in patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation is not uniform and depends on many factors in addition to AFib.  The annual incidence is somewhere between 1-7%, which speaks for itself.  Anticoagulation lowers this risk by roughly 3 fold, for example from 6% annually to 2% annually.  The nubmers needed to treat will be in the 20-30 persons to prevent 1 annual stroke.  Strategies for anti-coagulation are many, and there is in my opinion no reasonable consensus.  The trend seems to be to manage with antiplatelet agents those with “low risk” uncomplicated nonvalvular AF where the annual stroke risk is estimated to be about 1%.  On the other end, advanced age patients and those who are felt to be more likely to suffer hemorrhagic complications from anticoagualtion are increasingly managed with antiplatelets even though stroke risk may be “high”.  The choice of anticoagulation agent is also becoming more and more complex, with different ones on the market.\n",

    "Interventional treatment of ischemic stroke is essentially treatment of large vessel occlusion, most of which (in the western population) is going to be embolic.  The simple goal is to re-establish blood flow in order to salvage brain.  The issues are many.  The brain is by far the most vulnerable organ to ischemia and hypoxia in the body.  Global hypoperfusion to the brain (cardiac arrest) will produce catastrophic brain damage in as little as 10-15 minutes, far quicker than the 3-4.5 hour “cutoff” for IV t-PA administration.  The reason for this is the presence of collaterals to the ischemic territory.  The robustness of collaterals largely determines the extent of brain “survivability”.  This dysfunctional but still salvageable brain is the “penumbra”.  For some people, there will be no penumbra in a few minutes. Others can last far beyond the 4.5 hour window.  On a population basis, with no data other than a head CT, the time window for t-PA intervention is about 3 to 4.5 hours, and is determined by a balance of tPA risk and benefit.\n",
    "Determining the size, location, and rate of loss of penumbra is complex.  Various approaches exist.  We emphasize the role of penumbra imaging, CT perfusion in our case, to determine which patients may benefit from restroation of blood flow.
